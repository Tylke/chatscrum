# out all (hash-tag unimportant) lines in Dockerfile that were not necessary and caused error in the <docker build --tag vince .>

For example, eniayomiapi.chatscrum.com was pointed to my elastic ip address. So i will change ciapi.chatscrum.com to eniayomiapi.chatscrum.com.

vinceapi.chatscrum.com

docker build --tag vince .
Task assigned: Open /web/Dockerfile on yournameserv and also update your nginx configuration file. 
DONE 
Edited line 87, not 82 --> Changed ciapi.chatscrum.com to vinceapi.chatscrum.com.       

54.244.159.9
vi chatscrum.com.conf

docker pull nginx
docker run -d -P nginx
docker rename 9e917018d629 chat

Task assigned: Edit the chatscrum.com.conf file to work with the 2 domains pointed to your elastic ip address. 
Your domain with api in it should be set on port 5000 while the other domain should be set on port 5100.

I believe I am done. I need to verify my elastic IP 54.244.159.9 is associated with vinceserv.auufline.org - AND - vinceservapi.auffline.org
